- [ ] cancellation test is failing. It relies on saturating the threadpool and
      starting the loop later AFAIR. I think I had this working at some point...
      How should it be fixed?
- [ ] automake needs to build liburing. All build systems need static hidden
      linkage for liburing.
- [ ] Android build: include io_uring?
- [ ] Windows: uv__platform_work_cancel stuff seems incorrect
- [ ] Verify that liburing returns ENOSYS if io_uring is not available
      (linux-core.c:151)
- [ ] Look into using iouring's support for cancellation (kernel-dependent).
- [ ] Use io_uring for current-position reads where possible (kernel-dependent).
- [ ] (later PRs) add support for statx, openat/openat2, close
