== Patches applied on top of liburing ==

 - 0000-kernel-compat.patch: Whereas configure tests for several kernel-defined
   types, we need these defined always to support the oldest Linux kernels that
   libuv supports.

== Procedure to create a patch file ==

 - Commit the changes
 - git format-patch -1 --stdout > foo.patch # where naming follows an increasing
                                            # number plus patch description.
 - git add foo.patch
 - git commit --amend

  As patches created in this way will feature a ChangeLog, there is no longer
the need to append this file with a description of what the patch does.

  If a change modifies enough things inside the root directory that the
intention is not immediately clear, generate a .patch file to go with your
change. If the change's modifications in the root directory are small, like:

#ifdef FEATURE_FLAG
use_special_feature();
#elif
use_default_behavior();
#endif

  then the intent is clear and a .patch file doesn't need to be generated (since
it would not provide much value).

  Ideally local changes should have a merge request featured in:
